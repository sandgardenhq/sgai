# Project management

This file is the durable, shared project log for this workspace.

Use it to capture decisions, open questions, and the current plan so work can continue across sessions and across agents.

## How to use this file

1. Read `GOAL.md` and this file before doing anything else.
2. Record important information as soon as it is discovered.
3. Keep entries small and scannable. Prefer bullets.
4. Include evidence (file paths, command outputs, links) when possible.
5. When something changes, append a new entry instead of rewriting history.

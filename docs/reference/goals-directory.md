# Contributing goals in `GOALS/`

This repository keeps occasional contribution proposals in the `GOALS/` directory.

## What goes in `GOALS/`

Add a markdown spec file that describes *what* to build (the proposal), rather than sending code changes.

The repository includes `GOALS/.gitkeep` so `GOALS/` stays tracked in version control even when no spec files exist.

## Naming convention

Use the convention described in the repository README:

- `YYYY_MM_DD_summarized_name.md` (example: `2025_12_23_add_parallel_execution.md`)

## Next step

Follow the PR steps in [README.md](../../README.md#contributing).

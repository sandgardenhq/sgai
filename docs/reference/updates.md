  "Additional Changes": [
    "Removed interactive configuration from frontmatter and CLI to simplify how interactive behavior is managed across the platform. The system now uses a persisted workflow auto-lock flag that is set after work-gate approval and is enforced consistently across the CLI, MCP tools, server APIs, and the web UI."

  "Additional Changes": [
    "The installation and README documentation were updated to standardize the project root directory naming and clarify how to start the server for workspace management. Specifically, the docs now use a lowercase `sgai` root directory, explain that `sgai serve` must be run from that root to manage workspaces, and add explicit README steps for `opencode` update/auth flows and model usage."

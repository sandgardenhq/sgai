the "sgai_find_skill" reports the path instead of the skill name, and it causes issues with the `skill` tool.

- [x] Update `sgai_find_skill` to return the skill name (frontmatter's `name`) instead of the path
- [x] Update the `sgai_find_skill` logic to be used ONLY for search (update descriptions too); when it does find an exact match, tell the client to call the tool `skill` (the one that OpenCode has embedded internally)

The last dialog, the "DEFINITION IS COMPLETE" doesn't only asks the question, but it doesn't provide any summary what I am approving.

- [x] Update `sgai_ask_user_work_gate` tool to accept a mandatory `summary` parameter, and update `coordinator.md` to instruct the model to compile and pass a comprehensive summary (GOAL items, brainstorming decisions, task breakdown, validation criteria) before asking for approval.

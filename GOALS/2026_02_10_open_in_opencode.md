in Standalone Repository and Forked Repository, whenever you see an `Open in Editor`, I want another button `Open In OpenCode`

- [x] `Open In OpenCode` takes the current agent and the current sessionID and opens it in OpenCode in a terminal
  - [x] remember to use the same environment variables
- [x] `Open In OpenCode` can only be called when the factory is running
  - [x] it must open TUI mode (`opencode` vs `opencode run` mode)
- [x] Assume OpenCode is _always_ available

- [x] on a newly created workspace, when I try to fork, `/workspaces/$workspace/fork/new` fails with
```
workspace is not a root
```

----
The fork mode seems to be broken.

when I create a new workspace `[ + ]` and I complete the wizard (mostly leaving everything empty), it gives me the root repository in fork mode.

- [x] The fork mode MUST ONLY be active when the a repository has forks (`jj workspace list`) should be able to tell you that.
- [x] When a repository doesn't have forks DON'T USE the fork mode

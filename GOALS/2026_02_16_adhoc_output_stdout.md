I like the adhoc inference runners (Run tab in workspace and Ad-Hoc in the Root Repository page in Forked Mode)

- [x] Ensure that when it shells out to opencode
  - [x] all the env vars that would be available for runWorkflow are also available
  - [x] ensure that the command executer also prints out to the sgai stdout/stderr with the same prefix logic that runWorkflows have.

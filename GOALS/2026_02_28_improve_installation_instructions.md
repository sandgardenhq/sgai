We need to improve INSTALLATION.md

- [ ] linux specific instructions
  - [ ] you must test for sudo and whether the sudo is in passwordless mode;
    - [ ] when sudo is not in passwordless mode, must INTERRUPT AND ALERT USER YOU CAN'T PROCEED WITH INSTALLATION
- [ ] when installing, you must avoid hitting permission errors
  - [ ] the most common problem is trying to access directories out of the current working directory, this is disabled. Refer to https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions#external-directories (you must keep the permission)

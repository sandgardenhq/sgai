I like AdRoc Run tabs, they are useful, however there are few problems we need to fix.

- [x] When I browse away and then back, I lose the state; it must survive me browsing away
- [x] In Mobile Phone, the Run Tab layout isn't great, it should be more vertical
- [x] I want to be able to store the history of messages sent in the Run tabs, and then be able to list and replay one of them
